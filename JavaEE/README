A working Jakarta EE app (WAR) named Exercise1.war running at http://localhost:8080/Exercise1.

MariaDB schema (SQL dump) with at least 3 tables (directors, actors, movies + a join table).

JSF pages + CDI/EJBs + JPA to:

Add movies (manual form or via OMDb API lookup by title).

Search movies by year (show directors + main actors).

List all titles & years; pick one → show full details.

OMDb API integration (JSON fetch and map to your entities).

README describing model multiplicities/constraints and how to run.
Database schema (≥3 tables)

DIRECTOR(id PK, name UNIQUE NOT NULL, birth_year NULL)

ACTOR(id PK, name UNIQUE NOT NULL)

MOVIE(id PK, title NOT NULL, year INT NOT NULL, genre VARCHAR, runtime_min INT CHECK >0,
plot_one_line TEXT, poster_url VARCHAR, imdb_id VARCHAR UNIQUE NULL, director_id FK→DIRECTOR)

MOVIE_ACTORS(movie_id FK, actor_id FK, PRIMARY KEY(movie_id, actor_id)) ← marks “main actors”

Suggested constraints:

UNIQUE(title, year) on MOVIE (avoid duplicates)

CHECK (year BETWEEN 1888 AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE)+1)

FK constraints with ON DELETE RESTRICT

Multiplicity: One Director → many Movies; one Movie → one Director.
Many Movies ↔ many Actors (through MOVIE_ACTORS).
“Main actors” = the actors you link in that join table.

JPA entities (short version)

Director ( @OneToMany(mappedBy="director") List<Movie> )

Actor ( @ManyToMany(mappedBy="actors") List<Movie> )

Movie ( @ManyToOne Director , @ManyToMany @JoinTable(name="MOVIE_ACTORS") Set<Actor> actors )

Core use cases (UI pages)
